Now that PO is a full time role the PO is really in charge of the backlog and has to make it their own intimate. So for this one the Acceptance Test should say exactly which user names should be set up. It is up to the PO what they want.. for example User1, User2, and User3.'

Just as an example, since I don't know the details of this project. The Acceptance Test should say User1 in Cohort1 should only be able to access Cohort1 site. If User1 tries to access Cohort2 then they should be restricted access with a message explaining they do not have permission to Cohort2 and a contact form to send to administrator if they feel the message is in error. Something like that. Acceptance Test should be very, very, very specific.'
