It seems like these 1,2,3 User Stories can be broken down to more granular. Such as whatever specifically is needed for AWS. Then installing the sites for each cohort site, then installing the LMS on each cohort site, then installing WooCommerce on each cohort site.

In general the Acceptance Test takes a LOT of work which is why a PO is a full time job and very difficult. The PO needs to fully understand all the aspects of the project and the intricate pieces and how they fit together. The PO relies on the team to estimate and provide more details to stories when needed but the PO is responsible for fully understanding the project, creating the User Stories, prioritizing based on the PO understanding of the project and feedback from stakeholders, and then accepting or rejecting after the sprint.'  : Edit to a committed User Story for Sprint 1
