The team each has leave for sick and vacation and the SM should just make sure everyone has visibility. The team should feel like the SM is doing a favor to the team by helping everyone keep track and not feel like the SM is a guard on their time.'  : Edit to a committed User Story for Sprint 1

The SM can log this and graph it for the team but again the team shouldn't feel like the SM is checking on their work. The team should feel the SM is really helping them out by providing the teams visibility into their sprints.'  : Edit to a committed User Story for Sprint 1

The idea of the Retrospective is to work through any issues. The SM should be the facilitator. To remind team of items, to suggest they discuss other issues, etc.. the SM doesn't need to solve all the problems but remind team and make sure everyone discusses openly.'  : Edit to a committed User Story for Sprint 1
